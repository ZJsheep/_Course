### 计算与人工智能
- Intensional def of AI
	- Use artifacts to simulate intelligent behaviour
	- def of intelligent behaviour:
		- in: a set of mental abilities (?
		- ex: the ability to see, to smell.....
			- to perfect the def...
			- classify:
				- Action (physical): move, ...
				- Perception (physical & mental): see, hear, smell, feel, ...
					- inputs
				- Cognition (mental): think, reason, calculate, communicate, ...
					- outputs
- Why AI is important
	- to enhance the speed, precision, effectiveness of human efforts
- Why AI is powerful
	- computationality
	- electrical E superiority over bio E
	- in def of computation:
		- executes a set ot instructions step by step
- Subfields of AI
	- to pass Turing Test:
		- robotics, CV, NLP, KR, automated reasoning, ML
	- let all done via computation
		- All done by ML? No
	- Limitations of data driven AI

### 知识表示
- represent：用某种方法表示已存在的知识（？
	- 中文，英文, ...
	- C 语言, ...
- a KR language unifying human language and computer language?

### 本体与描述逻辑
- 本体 Ontology
	- A conceptualization is an abstract simplified view of some seleted part of the world
		- world: physical objects
		- conceptualization: models of physical objects
- A computation model:
	- fix vocabulary relevant to domain
	- fix semantics of terms in vocabulary
- Standard reasoning：只要回答 yes or no
	- non-standard reasoning：why？
- Desprition Logics
